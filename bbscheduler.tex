%
\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Burst buffer drastically improves the performance of computational applications by providing high perceived IO bandwidth.
However, traditional batch schedulers have barely embraced the full potential of burst buffer technology in practice. 
%either barely knows BB's existence or cannot fully utilize them in practice.
In this paper, we model the execution of scientific applications
that generate tens of TB of data on a supercomputer equipped with burst buffer.
We characterize the lifetime of generic applications into three phases:
\textit{stage-in}, \textit{running}, and \textit{stage-out}.
We develop a novel burst-buffer-aware batch scheduler \textit{Cerberus} to 
manage resource allocation in different phases.
In both stage-in and stage-out phases, Cerberus
allocates the burst buffer resources to achieve the maximum data transfer throughput
between burst buffer and the external storage system.
In the running phase, Cerberus maximizes the predefined objectives of job scheduling.
We evaluate our design through extensive event driven simulations. 
Our preliminary results demonstrate that
1) compared to non-burst-buffer systems, Cerberus accelerates the job execution, reduces the job response time, and improves average system throughput by 192\%;
2) three-phase based Cerberus extra boosts the average system throughput by 62\% comparing to traditional static burst-buffer-aware batch scheduler.
